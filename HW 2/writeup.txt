At the first level we have the TrieNode class. This class deals with each node that exists in the tree. It contains a character, a dictionary of children, a list of children, and a boolean for end of word. It contains methods that return its character, children and end of word status. Since the trie is a hybrid, it has separate methods for dealing with the dictionary and list, as well as a method that converts from a list to a dictionary. The next level is the trie class. This class manages a collection of TrieNodes in a tree structure, with each node containing a character of a title. Its only field is the root node. It has methods that add a line to the trie using recursion, match the given prefix to a spot in the tree, and that find completions for that prefix recursively. At the next level we have the web service file. This file outlines methods that can be called through the browser. This is how data that is returned from the trie class can reach the website. It contains 4 web methods: createTrie, downloadWiki, getMem, and findSuggestions. Values returned from these methods are displayed on the webpage. The final level is the web level. This contains the html and css that display the page, as well as the javascript that dynamically adds search results to the page. The website uses a javascript ajax post request to send the input in the search box to the webservice and displays the results that are returned in a JSON object.

I started out by setting up my ec2 server. I then used Putty to run the commands to set up the server. After finding where I had to put my files and confirming that I could see them, I turned to the RDS. After setting it up, I configured PHPMyAdmin to connect to it and upload the data file. The code that takes this data and displays it properly consists of 4 different files:

The first one is index.php. This file first uses HTML to create the title, searchbox, and the table headers. Then it uses PHP to send a MYSQL query to the RDS using a PDO. All of the queries that are sent use prepared statements. When the results are returnted, he displayResults function is called. This takes the results, processes it as a json object and echoes the proper html elements. It also provides a link to the players' wikipedia page in their name.

Main.js is a javascript/JQuery file that handles the AJAX searching. It adds an onkeyup event to the searchbox. This means that everytime a key is pressed and a character is added to the searchbox, a new search is processed. This event handler sends a post request to search.php with the current contents of the searchbox. Upon receiving the results. It clears the table and puts the results in the table.

Search.php takes the POST request and creates a query using wildcard operators so that and name that contains those concurrent letters will be returned. Because the query I set up before wouldn't accept any wildcard characters I had to set up a new PDO. To get the % signs in the query, I had to use the bindValue function. Once the results are returned, they are converted into a JSON object and echoed back to Main.js.

Main.css handles the styles for the page. It just arranges some of the elements on the page. I also used the Bootstrap css classes to style both the searchbox and the table.
